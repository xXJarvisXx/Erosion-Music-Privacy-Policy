The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.
